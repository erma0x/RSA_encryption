RSA encryption messages, verify and save private and public keys

## Description
The RSA algorithm is a public key encryption method that helps protect sensitive data during online communications. 

It is based on the mathematics of prime numbers and uses a pair of keys: one public, accessible to all, and one private, to which only the recipient has access. 

The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt. 

The security of the RSA algorithm is guaranteed by the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers into prime numbers.
